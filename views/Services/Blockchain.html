        <h1> BlockChain Technology </h1>
      <p> A blockchain is a convention that offers a decentralized system to confirm and approve exchanges inside a system. A set of validated and verified records is called a block. Blocks are added by linking to a previous block following the protocol, to form a linear and chronological chain of blocks–a blockchain. Blockchain innovation offers open and transparent, straightforward handling and recording of data, sets up trust in the absence of an intermediary, incorporates joint effort over the system, and guarantees data respectability. The appropriate uses of cryptographic protocols ensure data security. Due to decentralized networks, blockchain does not have a central point of failure and is better able to withstand malicious attacks. The changes in the blockchain ledger can be viewed by all the players in the network. Unlike normal ledger which gets updated, all the transactions remain in the blockchain ledgers. Overhead and transaction costs are reduced as compared to normal payment systems. It also eliminates the obstacle of transaction time needed for clearing and settlement of the payment services available. It is a 24x7 service. In the event that any block in the blockchain acquires a coincidental error or is altered with, the block containing the hash pointer of the mistaken block won't coordinate any longer. Along these lines, any accidental mistake might be followed in a blockchain. Independent of the correct mining process that updates the blockchain record, it is basic to guarantee that the ledger is all around acknowledged over the system at any given purpose of time. This warrants for a consensus in the convention. This decentralized consensus mechanism guarantees a predictable form of the blockchain record among all individuals from the system, and gives the most imperative tamper free and tamper resilient property to the blockchain. All these properties of blockchain make it an attractive proposition for the banks in payment system and they are of the opinion that blockchain technology can disrupt the payment system and this is the future of financial innovations.</p>


      <p>Even after so many advantages of this technology over the existing payment systems, there are certain limitations of blockchain technology. To begin with, blockchain technology has huge initial capital requirements and the process of mining consumes huge power.Moreover, the technology and infrastructure is at experimental stages, far away from being implemented. The nationalized banks with so much NPAs may not be able to invest heavily at the moment on blockchain technology. Blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. Last, but not the least, cultural adoption is one of the major hurdles for any innovation technology. Even after demonetization, 268% of the people in India prefer using cash in hand, which is a large number as compared to developed economies and even China.
Many countries and banks (some of whom have even banned bitcoins) are considering the blockchain technology as more efficient method of payments. Some of the uses of blockchain technology are:-</p>


<ul id="styles-list">
  
  <li>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is accepted across country borders.</li>
  <li>Some of world’s largest banks have formed the blockchain consortium, R3, to collaborate on a distributed ledger for faster, secure, efficient and transparent financial transactions.</li>
  <li>Smart contracts</li>
  <li>Payment systems</li>
  <li>In India, ICICI Bank in association with EdgeVerve Systems, a subsidiary of Infosys has used distributed ledger technology for financing trade outside India with Emirates NBD and have given positive reviews about the technology.</li>
