          <h3>Money Laundering Pattern Detection</h3>
         
          <p>Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to a set of procedures, laws or regulations designed to stop the practice of generating income through illegal actions. In most cases, money launderers hide their actions through a series of steps that make it look like money that came from illegal or unethical sources are earned legitimately.
         </p>
         <p>
           Most of the major banks across the globe are shifting from rule based software systems to artificial intelligence based systems which are more robust and intelligent to the anti-money laundering patterns. Over the coming years, these systems are only set to become more and more accurate and fast with the continuous innovations and improvements in the field of artificial intelligence.

          <h3>Chat Bots</h3>
         
          <p>Chat bots are artificial intelligence based automated chat systems which simulate human chats without any human interventions. They work by identifying the context and emotions in the text chat by the human end user and respond to them with the most appropriate reply. With time, these chat bots collect massive amount of data for the behavior and habits of the user and learns the behavior of user which helps to adapts to the needs and moods of the end user.
</p>
<p>Chat bots are already being extensively used in the banking industry to revolutionize the customer relationship management at personal level. Bank of America plans to provide customers with a virtual assistant named “Erica” who will use artificial intelligence to make suggestions over mobile phones for improving their financial affairs. ALSO, released by Google is another generic realization of chat bots.

          <h3>Algorithmic Trading</h3>
         
          <p>Plenty of Hedge funds across the globe are using high end systems to deploy artificial intelligence models which learn by taking input from several sources of variation in financial markets and sentiments about the entity to make investment decisions on the fly. Reports claim that more than 70% of the trading today is actually carried out by automated artificial intelligence systems. Most of these hedge funds follow different strategies for making high frequency trades (HFTs) as soon as they identify a trading opportunity based on the inputs.

<p>A few hedge funds active in AI space are: Two Sigma, PDT Partners, DE Shaw, Winton Capital Management, Ketchum Trading, LLC, Citadel, Voleon, Vatic Labs, Cubist, Point72, Man AHL

          <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
         
          <p>Fraud detection is one of the fields which has received massive boost in providing accurate and superior results with the intervention of artificial intelligence. It’s one of the key areas in banking sector where artificial intelligence systems have excelled the most. Starting from the early example of successful implementation of data analysis techniques in the banking industry is the FICO Falcon fraud assessment system, which is based on a neural network shell to deployment of sophisticated deep learning based artificial intelligence systems today, fraud detection has come a long way and is expected to further grow in coming years</p>

          <h3>Investment Advisory</h3>
         
          <p>essentially replacing human financial advisors with robo-advisors that use big data, machine learning and AI to cherry-pick the best investment opportunities for the new generation of investors.
</p>
<p>It allows a user to invest their spare change into companies they love by employing machine learning to create customized stock portfolios based on the individual’s unique interests and preferences. The portfolio automatically adapts to keep up with the user’s changing lifestyle, while also replicating the diversification provided by an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.

        <h1> AI in Banking </h1>
        According to World Bank report  , the world has to produce % more food by the year  2050  if the population continues to grow at the current rate. But it can be seen that the climate change is affecting the crop productions. So initiatives like autonomous tractors, ground-based sensors, flying drones and enclosed hydroponic farms can help farmers to produce more food at a lower cost .It's not very far that instead of cattle's on the field autonomous machines would be tilling , sowing and harvesting our agricultural fields. 

        <ul id="styles-list">
<li> Driverless tractors which  can follow pre-programmed routes are already in use at large farms across  the globe.</li>
<li> Drones are roaming  over fields analysing  crop health and soil conditions. Ground sensors are monitoring the amount of moisture and nutrients in the soil, initiating irrigation and fertiliser applications.</li>
<li> In Japan, the world's first entirely automated lettuce farm is set to  launch  this year. Japanese firm Spread's automated vegetable factory in Kyoto to be  launch this year can produce 30,000 lettuces a day.</li>
<li> Bosch's start-up Deepfield, based out of  Germany, is working to automate the growing and testing of seed crops, tracking the susceptibility to weeds and drought of different genetic varieties.</li>
<li> Engineers from Harper Adams University along  with a North Yorkshire farming technology company named Precision Decisions are working on  prototype machines and targets to plant their crop in March for harvest in September.</li>
<li> Shortage of farm labour in France's Burgundy region has led inventor Christophe Millot to develop a vine-pruning robot called Wall-Ye. The latest version of this trundling four-wheeled robot can make a cut every five seconds. It has six cameras some are with infrared sensors and two arms, and is operated by a tablet computer inside.</li>
</ul>

 <p>Artificial Intelligence works on certain set of data of event happened earlier and based on those data suitable predictions are made. But in the most cases in agricultural sector the data regarding precipitation rate, wind movement and many more valuable data are not collected or never been collected. In Agricultural Sector data of one type can be collected once in a year . So a lot of time and cost are involved in the implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture.
Any major initiative in a major scale can be successfully implemented only with the help of state or governments. Only very few countries mostly of developed countries like Britain , USA , China have taken the initiative to introduce AI in agriculture to increase productivity and enhance quality of food grains on the note of rising global population in the world.
In this initiative farmers play a key role .  They are the ones who will be directly using the application and will directly get benefitted from this initiative. So bringing them in the loop with proper awareness is a mandatory act for the success of this initiative.
The bridge between the Government Initiatives and the implementation of AI at the farmer level is the technology companies which will be using its technical resources to build up the whole AI ecosystem to function smoothly and accurately.</p>
